# StreamDirector

> **This is an experimental test project — not a finished product.**
> The entire codebase was generated by [Claude Code](https://claude.ai) (Anthropic) as a proof of concept.
> Expect rough edges, missing features, and no guarantees of stability.

Lightweight multiview Twitch dashboard packaged as an Electron desktop app.
Designed for 1920x1080 OBS window capture in live productions.

## Download

Grab the portable `.exe` from the [latest release](https://github.com/stefanpoensgen/stream-director/releases/latest). No installation required.

> **Windows SmartScreen:** Since the app is not code-signed, Windows Defender may show a warning on first launch. Click **"More info"** → **"Run anyway"** to proceed.

## Usage

- **Add channels** via the sidebar input or the **Import** button (paste a list, one per line). Check the [Discussions](https://github.com/stefanpoensgen/stream-director/discussions) for ready-made channel lists for upcoming events
- **Toggle** channels live with the switch in the sidebar
- **Click** a channel name to focus it (large view + audio)
- **Start All** activates all live channels at once

## Hotkeys

| Key       | Action                            |
| --------- | --------------------------------- |
| `←` / `→` | Cycle focus through live channels |
| `F`       | Recall last focused channel       |
| `S`       | Toggle sidebar                    |
| `Escape`  | Close import modal                |

## Window Controls

The app runs as a frameless window. Controls are in the bottom-left corner:

- **Drag** the logo area to move the window
- **Menu** toggles the sidebar
- **Login** opens Twitch login — the session is shared with all embeds, so a Twitch Turbo subscription removes ads on all streams
- **Close** (✕) closes the app

## Layout

L-shape grid optimized for 1920x1080:

- **Left column** (240px): up to 7 tiles stacked vertically
- **Focus area**: remaining width, top-right
- **Bottom row** (135px): additional tiles
- **Bottom-left cell**: branding, drag handle, menu/login/close buttons

Focus switches only toggle CSS classes and mute/unmute — no iframe reload, no DOM re-parenting.

### Architecture

```
electron.js       Electron main process, local HTTP server
index.html        App shell, Twitch embed API
app.js            State management, player lifecycle, hotkeys
styles.css        Dark theme, CSS Grid layout
```

State is persisted in `localStorage`. Max 14 simultaneous players with LRU eviction.

### Release

Tag a version to trigger a GitHub Action that builds the portable `.exe` and creates a release:

```bash
git tag v1.0.0
git push --tags
```
